This Java code defines a class named IncomeCalc that contains a main method and a computeIncome method. The main method prints a table of sales amounts and the corresponding income based on those sales amounts. It iterates over sales amounts from $1000 to $20000 in increments of $1000 and prints the sales amount along with the computed income for each amount.

The computeIncome method takes a sales amount as input and calculates the income based on a commission scheme. It uses conditional statements (if, else if, and else) to determine the commission rate based on the sales amount. Then, it calculates the commission and adds it to a base salary of $5000 to get the total income.

Key programming concepts and tools employed in this assignment include:
Methods: The use of methods (computeIncome) to encapsulate functionality and promote code reuse.
Looping: The for loop in the main method to iterate over sales amounts.
Conditional Statements: The if, else if, and else statements in the computeIncome method to determine the commission rate based on different sales amount ranges.
Printing Output: The use of System.out.println and System.out.printf to print formatted output.

The expected inputs for the application are sales amounts ranging from $1000 to $20000 in increments of $1000. The output is a table showing the sales amount and the corresponding income for each sales amount, calculated based on the commission scheme specified in the computeIncome method.
